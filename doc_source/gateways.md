# Ingesting data using a gateway<a name="gateways"></a>

An AWS IoT SiteWise gateway connects to data servers to deliver your industrial data streams to the AWS Cloud\. AWS IoT SiteWise supports [OPC\-UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC_Unified_Architecture), [Modbus TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus), and [Ethernet/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherNet/IP) data server protocols\. You can deploy the AWS IoT SiteWise provided AWS IoT Greengrass connectors on any device or platform that can run AWS IoT Greengrass\.

**Note**  
This documentation describes how to set up the latest version of the AWS IoT SiteWise connector, version 9\. For more information and the connector version changelog, see the [AWS IoT SiteWise connector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/iot-sitewise-connector.html) in the *AWS IoT Greengrass Developer Guide*\.
