# Using AWS IoT SiteWise gateways<a name="gateways-ggv2"></a>

A gateway serves as the intermediary between your servers and AWS IoT SiteWise\. The gateway runs on AWS IoT Greengrass V2 that supports data collection and processing on premises\. You can use AWS OpsHub to manage your gateways and monitor on\-site operations\.

You can also access SiteWise Monitor portals on your gateway devices\. For more information, see [Enabling your portal at the edge](monitor-additional-features.md#portals-at-edge)\.

**Note**  
Gateways running on AWS IoT Greengrass V1 are available only if you started using this feature before July 29, 2021\. Otherwise, you [set up gateways running on AWS IoT Greengrass V2](configure-gateway-ggv2.md)\.
