# Comparison functions<a name="expression-comparison-functions"></a>

In [transforms](transforms.md) and [metrics](metrics.md), you can use the following comparison functions to compare two values and output `1` \(true\) or `0` \(false\)\. AWS IoT SiteWise compares strings by [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order)\.


| Function | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `gt(x, y)`  |  Returns `1` if `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `0` \(`x > y`\)\. <a name="comparison-function-incompatible-types"></a>This function doesn't return a value if `x` and `y` are incompatible types, such as a number and a string\.  | 
|  `gte(x, y)`  |  Returns `1` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, otherwise `0` \(`x ≥ y`\)\. <a name="comparison-function-relative-tolerance"></a>AWS IoT SiteWise considers the arguments equal if they are within a relative tolerance of `1E-9`\. This behaves similar to the [isclose](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose) function in Python\. <a name="comparison-function-incompatible-types"></a>This function doesn't return a value if `x` and `y` are incompatible types, such as a number and a string\.  | 
|  `eq(x, y)`  |  Returns `1` if `x` is equal to `y`, otherwise `0` \(`x == y`\)\. <a name="comparison-function-relative-tolerance"></a>AWS IoT SiteWise considers the arguments equal if they are within a relative tolerance of `1E-9`\. This behaves similar to the [isclose](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose) function in Python\. <a name="comparison-function-incompatible-types"></a>This function doesn't return a value if `x` and `y` are incompatible types, such as a number and a string\.  | 
|  `neq(x, y)`  |  Returns `1` if `x` is not equal to `y`, otherwise `0` \(`x == y`\)\. This function doesn't consider any tolerances\. <a name="comparison-function-incompatible-types"></a>This function doesn't return a value if `x` and `y` are incompatible types, such as a number and a string\.  | 
|  `lt(x, y)`  |  Returns `1` if `x` is less than `y`, otherwise `0` \(`x < y`\)\. <a name="comparison-function-incompatible-types"></a>This function doesn't return a value if `x` and `y` are incompatible types, such as a number and a string\.  | 
|  `lte(x, y)`  |  Returns `1` if `x` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `0` \(`x ≤ y`\)\. <a name="comparison-function-relative-tolerance"></a>AWS IoT SiteWise considers the arguments equal if they are within a relative tolerance of `1E-9`\. This behaves similar to the [isclose](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose) function in Python\. <a name="comparison-function-incompatible-types"></a>This function doesn't return a value if `x` and `y` are incompatible types, such as a number and a string\.  | 
|  `isnan(x)`  |  Returns `1` if `x` is equal to `NaN`, otherwise `0`\. This function doesn't return a value if `x` is a string\.  |
